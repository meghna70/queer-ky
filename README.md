# Queerky


We aim to provide an interactive social media website for the LGBTQ+ community to share stories, pictures and events to support each other. Our website aims to make LGBTQ+ community feel included and heard, it aims to give people of all ages a shelter to express themselves and feel confident. A platform to connect with similar individuals and form a community with them.  Queerky is a social media through the queer lens. It focuses on being the safe space that this community deserves in the darkest of times as they see other people from their community living their best life despite limitations.
